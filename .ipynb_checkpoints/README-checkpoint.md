## Algo Trading

   1.  What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing the training window?
   
   Decreasing the training window did not help the performance of the model at all.  While increasing the window helped, but only to a certain extent.
   
   2.  What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing either or both of the SMA windows?
   
   Slighty increasing the SMA features, both Fast and Slow, also helped improve the models baseline performance.
   
   3.  Choose the set of parameters that best improved the trading algorithm returns.
   
  The parameters I used that led to the accompanying PNG image: 
   Short Window =15
   Long Window =200
   Training Period = 24 months
  
  4.  Evaluating New Machine Learning Classifier.  
  The new classifier I used was the DecisionTreeClassifier.
  
  5.  Did this new model perform better or worse than the provided baseline model? Did this new model perform better or worse than your tuned trading algorithm?
  The new model performed about the same as the baseline model, but performed worse than my tuned trading algorithm.
